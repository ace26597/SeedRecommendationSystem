<h1>Garlic</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>In India, garlic is planted as both kharif (June-July) and rabi (October-November)
crop- it depends on the regions. </p>
<p>It is planted as a rabi crop in Andhra Pradesh, Bihar,
Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Orissa, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan, Bengal and hilly
regions. It is both kharif and rabi crop in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Maharashtra,
Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh.</p>
<p>Garlic can grow in different types of soil, loamy soil with natural drainage is optimum
for this crop.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Garlic is a bulb crop producing shallow roots. It therefore, requires a good amount of
moisture- more than water. Perhaps the biggest challenge in garlic cultivation is being able to
‘moisture it right’. In other words, there should be enough water to maintain a good level of
moisture in soil. However, too much water would result in water stress and thus splitting of
the bulbs. Too little water or moisture level again means under-developed bulbs. The best
way is to irrigate the crop frequently.
<p>It must be irrigated:</p>
<p>Immediately after planting</p>
<p>At an interval of one week to 10 days depending on the moisture content in soil.
In case of drip irrigation, the discharge flow rate of the emitters must be 4liters per
hour.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>For Onion Yellow Dwarf disease Foliar spraying of carbosulfan (0.2%) or fipronil (0.1%) to
control aphids is one of the measures.</p>
<p>For Leek Yellow Stripe Foliar spraying of carbosulfan (0.2%) or fipronil (0.1%) to control
aphids is one of the measures.</p>
<p>For Irish Yellow Spot avoid crop stress ,control thrips, use healthy planting material.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
Garlic is ready to harvest within 120-150 days of sowing depending on the variety. They are
ready when the leaves start yellowing and become dry. The bulbs are then pulled out, sheath
cut near the bulb and roots are trimmed. They are then sun-dried for a week. This process is
important for the hardening of the bulbs. Before storing they are graded according to the size
and weight.
