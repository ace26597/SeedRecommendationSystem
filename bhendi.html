<h1>Bhendi</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Bhendi is one of the popular vegetable in India. It is cultivated extensively all the year round for its immature fruits. Bhendi fruits are used as a vegetable. The stem of the plant is used for the extraction of the fiber. Bhendi is a warm season vegetable crop and requires a long warm growing season.</p>
<p>In India it is grown is summer months and during the rainy season. It grows best in comparatively lighter soils ranging from sandy loam to loam though it gives a normal crop in relatively heavier soils also.It grows very well in a pH range of 6.0 and does very well in humid tropics with a temperature orange of 25-30oC.The land should be well prepared with 2 or 3 ploughings and should have proper drainage system.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Pre sowing irrigation should be given in the soils having no sufficient moisture. 
 First irrigation is given just after sowing and then the field is irrigated after 4 to 5 days in summer and 10 to 12 days in winter season. 
Over irrigation makes the crop to prolong it's vegetative phase without reaching reproductive stage.
Depending on the soil moisture availability the crop should be irrigated at frequent intervals.</p>
<p>At the time of sowing enough of moisture should be available to help germination.
For a continuous growth and pod formation the crop should be irrigated every 5th or 6th day during hot season and every fortnight during cold season and as and when required for rainy season crop.
Care must be taken to drain off excess irrigation or rainwater, because water stagnation adversely affects the plant growth.
</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>20 to 25 tonnes well rottened FYM mixed with soil during field preparation. For rainy season, crop apply 50 kg; N, 50kg P2O5 per hectare. For summer season 40 kg N, 40 kg P2O5 should be applied.</p>
<p>Weeding, thinning and earthling up is the important intercultural operations of bhendi. Earthing up in the rows should be done in rainy season crop. Application of herbicides for controlling weeds in bhendi is found effective. Basalin (Fluchoralin 48 per cent) @ 1-2 liter per hectare, and soil application of Tok-E-25 @ 5 liter per hectare effectively controlled the weeds.</p>
<p>Aphids (Aphis gossypii){ Nymphs are light yellowish green or greenish black or brownish.
Adults are mostly wingless but few winged forms also seen.}For this Seed treatment with Imidacloprid (5g/kg seed) keeps the crop free of sucking pests over a month.
Dimethoate or methyl Demeton or Phosphomidan can be used for control.</p>
<p>Gram Caterpillar (American Boll Worm)/(Helicoverpa armigera) It is active throughout the year. Inter crops like Green gram, Black gram, Groundnut, Soybean should be sown.
Sow 3-4 lines of maize (or) Jowar around the bhendi crop to monitor the moth.
</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>Flowering begins from 35 to 40 days after sowing and fruits are ready for harvest four to five days after flowering Bhendi pods may be harvested continuously at some intervals. The young fruits can be harvested in the morning. Delay in harvesting may make the fruits fibrous and they loose their tenderness and taste.
</p>
<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>The fresh vegetables are stored at temperature below 100C with a high humidity to prevent damage.</p>
