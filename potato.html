<h1>Potato 
</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Being a rabi season crop, it is usually cultivated during the months from October to December. This is the time when the weather is neither hot nor cold. Since the monsoons are nearly over at this time, it is an ideal time for cultivating potato crop. Being a cool season crop, the best place for potato farming are places with a cool climate, fertile soil and good moisture. 
</p>
<p>Soil temperature of 17-19⁰C is ideal for potato tuber formation. Bright sunshine during day and cool nights are optimal for potato growing. Potato tubers require ample amount of air and water. In addition they need space underground to expand and swell in size as they grow. Therefore, a loose, loamy soil is optimal.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>For potato, the daily crop water requirement is 4-5mm a day. For a better yield, irrigation must be done immediately after sowing. On an average, they need 4-5 mm water per day- just enough to maintain the moisture level, temperature and thus promote uniform tuber formation. The last lot of irrigation is done about fifteen days prior to harvesting.
</p>

<li>Germination
</li>For assured, rapid, uniform emergence of seedlings and good uniform crop stand at the start; and synchronous maturity at the end of crop season.
<li>Stolonization
</li>Stolon formation initiation 30-35 days after the seeding of the crop.
This stage coincides with earthling up of the crop which is done to provide soft soil medium for development and growth of stolons (:the stolon is an under-ground stem, on the tip of which is borne a single tuber).
<li>Tuberization
</li>When the stolons, formed under-ground start to swell at the tips.
This follows 10-15 days after stolonization initiation.
Any shortage at this phase reduces the chances of stolons to be converted into tuber-bearing stolons, or tubers if formed may fail to progress in their size gain and remain as chats.
Early tuber development : Early tuber development phase is very critical, as the tuber development proceeds in order of precedence of their initiation & the tubers if once hindered in growth, would cease to grow & plants energy is then wasted in initiating new tubers or promoting of secondary tubers.
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>For Epilachna Beetle  Spraying 0.2% sevin is effective.
Cutworms where the worms actually cut the plants above the soil surface and feed on tubers thus reducing its value. For this flooding the field is an effective way of controlling the caterpillars and Temik or carbofuran is also effective in fighting against the worms.
Potato Tuber Moth leaves develop patches since the caterpillars drill and mine them ,tubers have tunnel-like holes in them that contain the excreta of the pest. For this healthy potatoes must be stored while infected ones must be immediately discarded since the pest causes damage at the storage level and covering the potatoes with a layer of sand above and below the potatoes would also help keep the disease in check.
</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>The harvesting time of potato is usually dependent on the weather and market prospects. In case of high demand in the market, harvesting is done slightly early. Irrigation of the plants is stopped at least a week before harvesting potatoes. Harvesting is done once the soil is completely dry. Some farmers kill the vines using Gramoxone Extra. This ensures a good skin set for the tubers. The treatment is done a week before harvesting. In order to avoid bruising or any other damage to the tubers, they are carefully dug using potato digger manually. There is no universal time for harvesting potatoes.
</p>
<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>Seed potatoes are stored at 2-4⁰C with 95% relative humidity until the next sowing season. Some farmers pre-treat them with chemicals in order to avoid infection by pests, nematodes and insects.</p>
