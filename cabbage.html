<h1>Cabbage</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Cabbage is an introduced vegetable crop in India, but it has adapted itself well and is grown all over the country. It is a rich source of vitamin A, B and C. It also contains minerals like phosphorus, potassium, calcium, sodium and iron. Use of cabbage prevents constipation, increases digestion and appetite. It is said to be good for person suffering from diabetes. Cabbage is commonly used as cooked vegetable. It also makes into a good salad mixed in tomato, green chilies, beet root, etc. Nice pickle is prepared from cabbage.</p>
<p>
The cabbage consists of thick leaves overlapping tightly on growing main bud called 'head’. Cabbage is very convenient to grow both on large and small-scale (kitchen garden) cultivation. Cabbage is grown throughout the country but it is more popular in Southern States where it is available all the year round. In northern India also, the cabbage availability period has been considerably extended with the development of tropical varieties/hybrids.</p>

<h3>Varieties</h3>
<p>
A large number of cabbage varieties differing in maturity, head shape and size, colour of leaves and shape of the leaves are grown throughout the world. All these types have been classified into different groups.</p>

<li>Early maturing varieties:</li> The varieties under this group are usually ready within 60-70 days after transplanting the seedlings. The varieties are: Golden Acre, Pride of India, Copenhagen Market, Early Drumhead, Pusa Mukta.

<li>Midseason varieties:</li> These varieties will be ready for harvesting in 80-90 days after planting. These varieties are: All Head early, Wisconsin, All Green, September.

<li>Late varieties:</li> These varieties require long winter season for good yield and quality. The heads are ready in 90-120 days after planting. The varieties under this group are : Pusa Drumhead, Danish Ballhead, Late Flat Dutch.

<li>F1Hybrids:</li> Besides above mentioned varieties, some F, hybrids are also being marketed by some of the seed companies. These are: Hari Rani, Shri Ganesh Gol, Kamdhenu (Mahyco), Sujata, Bajrang, Swati (Rallis India Ltd.), Ganga, Yamuna, Kaveri (Indo-American Hybrid Seed Co.), Green Express and Green Boy (National Seed Corporation).

<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>First irrigation is given soon after transplanting of seedlings and thereafter irrigation's may be applied at 10-15 days intervals. But optimum soil moisture should be maintained by frequent irrigation during critical period of head formation and development. Uneven moisture supply during this period may result into splitting or bursting of head adversely affecting the quality of produce.</p>

<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<li>Treat the seed with Captaf or Thirum (2g per kg of seed) and drench the nursery bed with captaf (2kg per litre of water) to control damping off disease.

<li>Spray the seedbeds with Metasystox (1ml. per litre of water) along with 3g of Blitox or 3g of Dithane M-45 at weekly interval.

<li>After transplanting, spray the crop with Malathion 2ml and 4g Dithane-45 in one first month upto harvesting stage

<h3>Harvesting</h3>
Cabbage heads should be harvested when they attain the full size depending on the variety used. They have a tendency to burst or loosen the leaves beyond the marketable stage. In such cases, the quality of heads deteriorated fast if harvesting is delayed. However, cultivars differ in their susceptibility to cracking.

<p><b><li>Green stage</b></p>
The fruits are fully developed but are green and suitable for sending to distant markets.

<p><b><li>Pink stage</b></p>
Some of the portion is red or pink and the fruit is not fully ripe. It is most suited for local
markets.

<p><b><li>Ripe stage</b></p>
The major portion of the fruit is red and the softening begins. It may be picked up for home
or table use

<p><b><li>Full ripe stage</b></p>
The fruit develops maximum colour and turns soft.
It is suited for processing purposes.

<h3>Post harvest handling and marketing</h3>
After harvesting, the outer mature unfolded leaves are removed, and if any long hard potion of stem is present, may also be removed. These heads are graded according to the size and quality and packed in gunny bags or plastic crates and transported to the markets in trucks.

The marketable heads can be stored for 2-3 weeks if arranged in crates and placed in well-ventilated place. They can be stored for several weeks in the Cold Storage at 00C to 1.70C with 85 to 87% relative humidity.
