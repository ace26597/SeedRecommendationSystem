<h1>Cardimum</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Small cardamom is a sought after spice in the Middle East market. It is cultivated in Kerala, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. India is the second largest producer of small cardamom.In organic cultivation of cardamom, the methods to be followed should conform to the standards laid down for the purpose. An isolation belt of at least 25 m wide is to be left from all around the conventional plantation. The produce from this area shall not be treated as organic. A conversion period of three years is required for an existing plantation for organic cultivation. For replanted and new planted areas, the produce from the fourth year onwards only shall be considered as organic produce. If organically produced planting materials are used and if at least two years have elapsed without use of any inorganic inputs in the field prior to planting, the yield from such a crop shall be considered as organic. In case of cultivation in virgin lands and farms wherein no chemical inputs have been applied in the past, the conversion period can be relaxed. In the case of wild cardamom plants available in the forest, the entire produce can be considered as organic.</p>
<p>Initially the seeds can be collected from any elite plantation even if they are not grown organically. However, the methods followed for raising seedlings should conform to the organic standards. If rhizomes are to be used as planting material, the plantation should have been following organic methods of production at least one year prior to collection.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Frequent watering 1 week to 2 week interval is required during hot summer months. Regular watering (25mm to 38mm/irrigation) helps in panicles initiation,flowering of plant and fruit set.Make sure the soils as enough moisture level all the time (at least 45-40 degree ).Overhead irrigation process/method is best suited to cardimum planations.Drip irrigation can also be used.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>The major fungal diseases affecting cardamom are azhukal (Phytophthora medii) and clump rot (Pythium vexans, Rhizoctonia solani and Fusarium sp.). Incorporation of Trichoderma multiplied in suitable organic medium in the plant base (1 kg per clump) prior to the onset of monsoon season (May) is a prophylactic operation for clump rot disease. Use of Bordeaux mixture 1 % when found necessary may be resorted to. Regular rouging of virus affected plants should be made to reduce the spread. Rouged plants should be destroyed by burning.</p>
<p>Removal of drooping dry leaves, dry leaf sheath, old panicles and other dry plant parts is an important sanitation method recommended for reducing the pest inoculum in the plantation. Mechanical collection and destruction of egg masses of pests, larvae of hairy caterpillar (Eupterote sp) and beetles of root grub (Balepta fuliscorna) are other approaches in reducing the pest damage. As soon as bore holes of stem borer (Conogethes punctiferalis) are noticed, injection of Bacillus thuringiensis preparation into the bore hole (0.5 ml in 10 ml water) will kill the larva so that subsequent resurgence can be reduced. Wherever organic methods of cultivation are adopted outbreak of white flies (Dialeurodes cardamomi) is seldom observed. However in the event of such outbreak, collection of adults using yellow sticky trap and control of nymphs by spraying neem oil with soft soap made out of minimum caustic soda (500 ml neem and 500 g soft soap in 100 litres of water) is to be followed. In areas prone for nematodes, (Meloidogine sp.) application of crushed neem seed can take care of the problems. Application of fish oil rosin soap may be made for managing thrips (Sciothrips cardamomi). Malabar varieties are found to be tolerant to thrips to a certain extent. Regular surveillance is absolutely essential for timely detection and adoption of remedial measures against the pests affecting cardamom.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>After harvesting, the freshly harvested capsules need to be cleaned from dirt. Curing of cardamom capsules is done by reducing the moisture from 80% to 8-12% at an optimum temperature by retaining green colour to the maximum extent.</p>
<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>
<li>Sun drying</li>

Cardamom is directly dried under the sunlight. Sun drying generally requires 5-6 days. It is not dependable during rainy season. This practice is followed only in some parts of Karnataka. By this method, it is not possible to obtain good green colour.

<li>Conventional curing</li>

This is the most commonly adopted method for curing cardamom. It requires a structure fitted with furnace, flue pipes, chimney, ventilators etc. It is a masonry structure consisting of two apartments, a curing room and a furnace room. Curing room is a tall one provided with ceiling at the roof and fitted with wire gauge on the beams at the middle of the room parallel to the ground floor, making the room into two compartments. Flue pipes having a radius of about 25 cms made of galvanized iron sheets are provided in the ground floor from one end to the other from the furnace to chimney pipe to expel the smoke through the roof. Racks holding rectangular trays are also fitted to the side walls for accommodating larger quantities of cardamom.

Capsules are spread in a single layer on the racks and trays. After spreading, the curing room is closed and heating is done by burning firewood in the furnace and the heat produced is conducted. Only fallen trees and lopped branches should be used as fuel. The hot smoke passes through the pipes bringing the room temperature to 45 to 50°C. This temperature is maintained for 3 to 4 hours. At this stage capsules sweat and give off moisture. Ventilators are then opened for sudden cooling and sweeping out vapour from the drying capsules. Ventilators are closed after vapour is escaped completely and temperature is maintained at 40°C for about 24 to 30 hours. Temperature is raised again to 45°C for one hour. The whole process of curing takes about 28 to 36 hours. In general, quality of capsules cured by this method is very good. Community curing is cheap and less polluting.</p>
