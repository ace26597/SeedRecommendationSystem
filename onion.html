<h1>Onion</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>In India, onions are cultivated both as kharif and rabi crop. This is because onions are grown
in almost all the Indian states. The time and season of onion cultivation depends on the
geographical location and weather at the particular place. Although it is a temperate crop,
onion cultivation can be possible under sub-tropical, temperate or tropical climate. A mild,
gentle weather that is not too rainy, too cold or too hot is ideal for onion growing. However,
it can withstand extreme weather conditions at younger stage. Short day onions that need 10-
12 hours of day length are grown in plains while long day onions requiring 13-14 hours of
day length are grown in the hilly areas.</p>
<p>Onion crops need lower temperature and shorter day light (photoperiod) for vegetative
growth while during the bulb development and maturity stage it needs a higher temperature
and longer day light.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>The commonly followed method of irrigation in onion is irrigate with basin or border strip
flooding or furrow irrigation on sandy loam soils, sub. Surface drip irrigation was found to be
better than surface drip irrigation. Onion must be kept growing with reasonably constant soil
moisture. Drastic soil moisture fluctuations result in set backs and in onion that new growth
after being retarded, the inner scals may split the outer ones causing splits and doubles. When
the plants start maturing, irrigations must be stopped and the soil must be allowed to dry as
much as possible, which facilitates the bulb to ripen sooner. Being a shallow-rooted crop,
onions need small amounts of irrigation at regular intervals.
In addition, dispensing water through drip or sprinkler emitter would ensure water at the root
of the plant. It prevents water seepage into the soil and thus water loss to a great extent.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>Use Dithane M-45 (0.25 %) for Stemphyllium Blight(Small yellow to pale orange streaks in
the middle of leaves.They will elongate into spindle shaped ovate spots, later turn brown
colour)</p>
<p>For Thrips (Thrips tabaci) Intercropping with maize or sugarcane is one of the best methods
of controlling thrips.Insecticides must be sprayed when the thrips population cross 30 per
plant.</p>
<p>For Eriphyid mites use 0.05% Sulphur spray ,0.2% dicofol as soon as symptoms
appear and then every 15 days thereon.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
Onion harvesting is done when the still green tops start drooping. The plants are gently pulled
out from the soil. However, 10-15 days before harvesting irrigation of the field is stopped.
The crop is also sprayed with 1000 ppm carbendazim 30 days before harvest. This helps
increase the shelf-life of the crop. The bulbs are cleaned and dried in shade for 4 days.
