<h1>Tomato</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Tomato is a day neutral plant so wildly it found grown in any season.
In the northern plains three crops are taken but in frost affected area rabi crop is not fruitful.
The kharif crop is transplanted in July, rabi crop in October - November and zaid crop in
February months.</p>
<p>In the southern plains where there is no danger of frost, The first transplanting is done in
December-January, Second June-July Third in September-October depending on the
irrigation facilities available.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Tomatoes need very careful irrigation that is just sufficient water at the right time. It is
necessary to maintain an even moisture supply. During summer season, irrigation at every 5to
7 days interval is necessary, whereas in winter 10 to 15 days interval is sufficient. A period of
drought followed by sudden heavy watering during the fruiting period may cause cracking of
fruits.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>Soil solorization or partial sterilisation of the soil by burning trash on the surface
Seed treatment with tricoderma 5-10g or carbendazim 2g or thirum3 g/Kg seed.
Spraying the plants with a mixture of Streptocycline 200 ppm and Copper oxychloride 3g per
litre of water gives fairly good control of the disease.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
Depending on the mode of disposal, the tomato fruits may be harvested at various stages of
maturity.
<p><b>Green stage</b></p>
The fruits are fully developed but are green and suitable for sending to distant markets.
<p><b>Pink stage</b></p>
Some of the portion is red or pink and the fruit is not fully ripe. It is most suited for local
markets.
<p><b>Ripe stage</b></p>
The major portion of the fruit is red and the softening begins. It may be picked up for home
or table use
<p><b>Full ripe stage</b></p>
The fruit develops maximum colour and turns soft.
It is suited for processing purposes.
