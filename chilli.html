<h1>Chilli</h1>
The chili pepper (also chile pepper, chilli pepper, or simply chilli[1]) from Nahuatl chīlli Nahuatl pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃiːli] (About this sound listen)) is the fruit of plants from the genus Capsicum, members of the nightshade family, Solanaceae.[2] They are widely used in many cuisines to add spiciness to dishes. The substances that give chili peppers their intensity when ingested or applied topically are capsaicin and related compounds known as capsaicinoids.<h3>Planning</h3>

Thoroughly prepare the field with the addition of FYM @ 25 t/ ha and form ridges and furrows at a spacing of 60 cm. Apply 2 kg/ha of Azospirillum and 2 kg / ha of Phosphobacteria by mixing with 20 kg of FYM. Irrigate the furrows and transplant 40-45 days old seedlings, with the ball of earth on the ridges.



<h3>Irrigation</h3>

<p>Irrigate is done at weekly intervals.</p>
<h3>Layout and planting for drip irrigation and fertigation<h3>

Apply FYM @ 25 t / ha as basal before last ploughing.
Apply 2 kg / ha of Azospirillum and 2 kg/ha Phosphobacteria by mixing with 20 kg of FYM.
Apply 75 % total recommended dose of superphosphate i.e. 375 kg / ha as basal.
Install the drip irrigation with main and sub main pipes and place lateral tubes at an interval of 1.5 m.
Place the drippers in lateral tubes at an interval of 60 cm and 50 cm spacing with 4 LPH and 3.5 LPH capacities respectively.
Form raised beds of 120 cm width at an interval of 30 cm and place the laterals at the centre of the each bed.
Before planting wet the beds using drip system for 8-12 hrs.
Planting to be done at a spacing of 90 x 60 x 45 cm in the paired row system, using ropes marked at 60 cm spacing.
Spray Pendimethalin 1.0 kg a.i. / ha or Fluchloralin 1.0 kg a.i / ha as pre-emergence herbicide at 3rd day after planting.
Gap filling to be done at 7th day after transplanting.
<h3>Harvest
Harvesting can be done 75 days after transplanting. First two picking yield green chilli and subsequently yield red ripe fruits.

<h3>Yield</h3>
Varieties : 2 - 3 t/ha of dry pods or 10 - 15 t/ha of green chillies.
Hybrids : 25 t / ha of green chillies.
<h3>Disease<h3>
1.Small yellow-green legions and necrotic patches on the leaves. This could also take the form of brown legions with yellow halos or patchy areas of dark and light green.

2. Leaf edge tissue becomes dry and brittle.

3. The symptoms will show first on older foliage, moving onto new growth soon after. Leaves eventually drop off.

4. Stems can develop brown cankers.

5. Fruits display pale, water-soaked legions, which later harden and become brown.
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<li>There is currently no cure so it is advised to remove any infected plants from the greenhouse to prevent spread. Other preventative measures include,

1. Prevent the initial infection with the use high quality or treaded seeds. 

2. Keep your greenhouse well ventilated and plants well spaced. 

3. Ease the spread of the disease by removing any infected plants from the greenhouse. General greenhouse hygiene is also crucial, so remove any dead plant material regularly.

4. The bacteria can survive in dead plant matter in the soil and be transmitted to plants through splashing water. Water gently or bottom water in a tray placed under the pot. 

5. A copper-based fungicide can prevent further spread of the disease if used in the early stages of infection.</li>
