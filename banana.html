<h1>Banana</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Banana is the oldest and commonest fruit known to the mankind. It is one of the important fruits, and constitutes second largest fruit industry in India.Being a tropical crop, banana requires warm, humid and rainy climate. The optimum temperature range is 10 to 400C and the relative humidity is 90% or above. It is highly susceptible to frost and cannot tolerate arid conditions. Strong desiccating winds cause considerable reduction in the growth of the plant and yield and quality of fruits.</p>
<p>Planting of banana is done by two methods viz. Pit method and furrow method. Planting is done from February to May whereas in North India, it is done during July-August. In South-India, it can be done any time of year except summer. Tall varieties should be planted at 3x3 m whereas dwarf ones at 2x2 m apart.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>For the entire life cycle of banana it needs 900-1200mm of water. This is generally met through rainfall and whatever extra is needed it is provided through irrigation. It is important to maintain the moisture level at optimum during all growth stages and also drain out the excess water from the root zone. This is important from the point of view of growth and productivity of banana tree. Irrigation is done once a week when the climate is cool and once in every 3 days under hot conditions. Drip irrigation, trench irrigation and flood are some of the common irrigation systems followed for cultivation of banana. Each of them have their own merits and demerits. However, the most economical and popular one is drip irrigation. This is because they ensure water being dispensed at the root zone.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<li>Panama Wilt</li>Intercropping,
Immediate removal of diseased plants along with surrounding soil,
Infection free planting material,
Injecting plant with 2% Carbendazim plus Agallol or Aretan soil drench.
<li>Mycosphaerella leaf spot</li>Destroying the infected leaves,
Intercropping,
Applying fungicides as soon as the infection is seen.
<li>Bacterial wilt</li>Leaves yellow and progress upwards , central corm portion appears discolored and fruits rot internally destroying the infected part.
Manual detection,
Farm implements must be sterilized and adequately cleaned with formaldehyde.
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>Harvesting of banana is done 12 to 15 months after planting in dwarf and 15 to 18 months after planting in tall varieties. Signs of maturity of banana fruits are, fruit becomes plumpy and angles are filled in completely, when tapped gives metallic sound, drying off of top leaves and change in colour of fruits from deep green to light green.</p>
<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>Once the treatment is done, they are packed in gunny bags. Those having a poor shelf life are sent immediately to the market while those that can last upto a week are stored in cool conditions.</p>
