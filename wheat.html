<h1>Wheat</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Wheat occupies the prime position among the food crops in the world. In India, it is the second important food crop being next to rice and contributes to the total foodgrain production of the country to the extent of about 25%. Wheat has played a very vital role in stabilizing the foodgrain production in the country over the past few years.</p>
<p>The origin of the durum wheats was probably in the region of Abyssinia, whereas the whole group of soft wheat, which includes the bread wheats, probably originated in the region of Pakistan, SouthWestern and the Southern parts of mountainous Bokhara.</p>

<h3>Land Preparation</h3>
The wheat crop requires a well-pulverized but compact seed bed for good and uniform germination. Three or four ploughings in the summer, repeated harrowing in the rainy season, followed by three or four cultivations and planking immediately before sowing produce a good, firm seed bed for the dry crop on alluvial soils. For the irrigated crop, the land is given a pre-sowing irrigation (palewa or raund) and the number of ploughings is reduced. Where white ants or other pests are a problem, Aldrin 5% or BHC 10% dust at the rate of 25 kg/ha should be applied to the soil after the last ploughing or before planking.

<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>The high yielding wheat varieties should be given five to six irrigations at their critical growth stages viz. Crown root initiation, tillering, jointing, flowering, milk and dough which come at 21-25 days after sowing (DAS), 45-60 DAS, 60-70 DAS, 90-95 DAS, 100-105 DAS and 120-125 DAS respectively. Off these irrigation at CRI stage is most important.</p>

<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>For controlling diseases following chemicals are used.
Preventive and control measures of the commonly occurring diseases in wheat
<li>1.Name of Disease:Smut</li>
<b>Preventive measures</b>
1.Use of healthy seeds
2. Roguing & burning of disease affected plants
3. Use of resistant varieties
4.Solar heat treatment
<li>2.Name of Diseases:Rust</li>
<b>Preventive measures:</b>
1. Use of resistant varieties
2.Timely sowing
</p>

<h3>Harvesting</h3>
The rain-fed crop reaches the harvest stage much earlier than the irrigated crop. 
The crop is harvested when the grains become hard and the straw becomes dry and brittle.
The harvesting is mostly done by sickle. The crop is threshed by treading with cattle on the threshing-flour or by power driven thresher.

<p><b>Green stage</b></p>
The fruits are fully developed but are green and suitable for sending to distant markets.

<p><b>Pink stage</b></p>
Some of the portion is red or pink and the fruit is not fully ripe. It is most suited for local
markets.

<p><b>Ripe stage</b></p>
The major portion of the fruit is red and the softening begins. It may be picked up for home
or table use

<p><b>Full ripe stage</b></p>
The fruit develops maximum colour and turns soft.
It is suited for processing purposes.

<p><b>Storage</b><p>
<p>The grains should be thoroughly dried before storage. The storage life of the grain is closely related to its moisture content. Grains with less than 10 percent moisture store well. 
The storage pits, bins or godowns should be moisture-proof and should be fumigated to keep down the stored – grain pests including rats. 
Zinc phosphide is very effective against rats.</p>
