<h1>Corn</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Maize crop is usually cultivated n India, during June to July , Sept to Oct and Jan to Feb
seasons.
<p>For seed production , sowing during Nov to Dec is suitable since seed maturity will not
concede with the rainy season.
With the availability of photononsensitive maize varieties, it is possible to grow maize
throughout the year. Maize can be cultivated in three seasons.</p>
<p>Kharif crop</p>
It is better to sow the Kharif crop at least fortnight before the rain starts to avoid problems
during sowing so that the seedlings are well established before they get heavy rains.
Early sowing also reduces weed problems, the crop matures earlier and field becomes free for
next rabi crop.
<p>Rabi crop</p>
The optimum date of sowing is end of October to mid December and crop is raised under
assured irrigation.
<p>Spring crop</p>
The crop is grown in Bihar, Maharastra and Tarai belt of UP and most optimum time of
sowing is late January to end of February.</p>
<p>In the southern plains where there is no danger of frost, The first transplanting is done in
December-January, Second June-July Third in September-October depending on the
irrigation facilities available.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Water requirement of Kharif maize is 400-550 mm while that of Rabi maize is 450-600 mm.
Even though maize roots can penetrate upto 120 cm., the density of roots is high only at 60
cm. First irrigation should be given upto 120 Cm, depth. Second irrigation after 10 to 15 days
depending upon soil, temperature and wind velocity. Schedule irrigations at more frequent
intervals in dry weather and less frequent intervals in humid weather.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>Use of resistant varieties like DHM 103, Ganga Safed 2.
Crop sanitation, crop rotations.</p>
<p>Avoiding water stress at flowering.</p>
<p>Seed treatment with Thiram or Captan 3g/kg seed.</p>
<p>To control Downy mildew remove the affected plants,spray Metalaxyl 72 WP @1kh per
hectare, Mancozeb 1 kg per hectare 20 days after sowing.
For leaf spot control spray Captan or Mancozeb kg per hectare if intensity is high.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
The grain crop can be harvested when cob-sheath turns brownish, grains become hard and
they do not contain more than 20 per cent moisture in them.
<p><b>Plucking of cobs</b></p>
The ears are removed from the standing plants and they are piled to open for twenty four
hours and they are spread for drying in the sun. In this method stalks may be used as green
fodder.
<p><b>Stalk cutting</b></p>
The plants are cut and piled up in the shade and the cobs are removed after two or three days
of harvesting. The dried plants are used for haymaking.Maize grown for fodder are harvested
at the milk to early dough stage. The earlier harvested crop usually yields less and is poor in
protein content. For silage making late dough stage is preferred.
