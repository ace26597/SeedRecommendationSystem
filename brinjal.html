<h1>Brinjal</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>The brinjal is a warm season crop, therefore susceptible to severe frost. Low temperature during the cool season causes deformation of fruits. A long and warm growing season is desirable for successful brinjal production. Cool nights and short summers are unsuited to satisfactory yield.  A daily mean temperature of 13 to 21C is most favourable for optimum growth and yield. The brinjal seed germinate well at 25C The time of sowing of seed and transplanting of seedlings varies according to the agro-climatic regions. </p>
<p>In the plants of Northern India, there are generally two sowing seasonâ€™s vez, June to July for autumn crop and November for the spring- summer crop month of April. In South India, the brinjal can be grown round the year, the main sowing being done during July to August. In the hills, the seeds are sown in March to April and seedlings are transplanted in May.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>Irrigation the field as per the need of crop. Timely irrigation is quite essential for good growth, flowering, fruit setting and development of fruits. Higher yield may be obtained at optimum moisture level and soil fertility conditions. In plains irrigation should be applied every third to fourth day during hot weather and every 7 to12 days during winter. Irrigation is given before top dressing of there is no rain. The brinjal field should be regularly irrigated to keep the soil moist during frosty days.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<li>Brinjal Fruit Borer (Helicoverpa armigera)</li>The pest is polyphagous in nature. The full grown larvae are greenish with dark broken grey lines along the side of body. They measure about 35-45 mm long. The moth is large and brown with V-shaped speck and dull black border on the hind wings. The larvae are feed first on leaves and fruiting bodies and later on, they bore into the fruits, completely eating away the internal contents. To control Spray the crop with Malathion (0.1%) or Endosulfan (0.05%) or Monocrotophos (0.05%)
<li>Aphids (Lipaphis erysimi)</li>The nymphs and adults are louse like and pale greenish in colour. This pest is very active from December to March when various cruciferous and vegetable crops are available in the fields. The damage is caused by nymphs and adults by sucking cell sap from leaves, stems, inflorescence or the developing plants. They are seen feeding in large numbers, often covering the entire surface. Owing to feeding on cell sap, the vitality of plants is greatly reduced. The leaves acquire a curly appearance.To control spray the crop with Malathion (0.1%) or Endosulfan (0.05%) or Monocrotophos (0.05%) interval.
<li>Root Knot Nematodes</li>These are the most common plant parasitic nematodes (Meloidogyne spp.i.e. incognita, javanica) in India and infestation of these nematodes is common in brinjal. The root knot nematode damage is more harmful to seedling than to older plants. These nematodes infest the roots and cause root galls. The affected plant becomes stunted and the leaves show chlorotic symptoms. Infestation of these nematodes greatly hampers the yield of the crop.To control do deep summer ploughing,follow crop rotation ,grow resistant verities like Black beauty,banaras Ginat.Incorporate Carbofuran or phorate @ 25 kg/ ha in the soil.
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
<p>The brinjal fruits are harvested when they attain full size and colour but before start of ripening. Tenderness bright colour and glossy appearance of fruit is the optimum stage of harvesting of fruits. When the fruits look dull, it is an indication of maturity and loss of quality
The yield varies from season to season, variety to variety and location to location. However, in general 250 to 500 q/ha of healthy fruits of brinjal can be obtained.</p>
<h4>Storage</h4>
<p>The fruit can be stored for two to three days during winter and one to two days during summer under ordinary conditions but it can be kept for about a week in a fairly good conditions at 7.2o to 100 C and 85 to 95% relative humidity.
Brinjal fruits are sensitive to chilling injury below 500F and deteriorate rapidly at warm temperatures, so they are not adapted to long storage.
Pitting, surface bronzing, and browning of seeds are symptoms of chilling injury.</p>
