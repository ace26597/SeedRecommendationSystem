<h1>Capsicum</h1>
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Seeds are sown in the nursery beds at the end of October. The seedlings are protected from
frost during December-January by covering with polythene sheet or sarkanda cover and
transplanted in mid February. To raise early crop, the seed can also be sown in nursery in mid
October and transplanted in end November.</p>
<p>
Sweet pepper is more sensitive to unfavorable environment. The optimum night temperature
for quality fruit production is 16-18 o C. When the temperature falls below 16oC for
extended periods, growth and yields usually decrease. It can tolerate day temperature over
30oC. High temperature and dry winds result in flower and fruiting. Sweet pepper is
insensitive to photoperiod and humidity.Sweet pepper grows better in a loam or sandy loam
soil with good water holding capacity. They can be grown on all types of soils, as long as it is
well drained. Soil pH should be between 5.5-6.8.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>First irrigation should be given immediately after transplanting. Afterwards irrigation is given
at 4 to 5 days interval during hot weather and 7 to 8 days during cold weather.
In drip irrigation there should be daily supply of water upto 2-3 litres per square meter per
every day.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<p>Thrips and mites this sucking pest affects most of the crops. Capsicum are self pollinating but
there is high degree of cross pollination because of honeybees
hrips, mites, aphids and whitefly are the serious pests of these crops. For their control spray
the crop with 400 ml of Malathion 50 EC in 100-125 litres of water at 15-20 days interval.</p>
<h3>Harvesting</h3>
The crop is ready for harvest in about 3 months after transplanting. Pick the fruits when they
are fully developed but still green and shining.
<h3>Storage</h3>
<p>Capsicum fruits are graded on basis of colour to ensure attractive pack. Each fruit is shrink
wrap and stored in 7-8 degree Celsius for 40-45 days.</p>
