<h1>castor</h1>
The hull contains a deadly poison called ricin. Castor oil has been used as medicine for centuries. Castor seeds without the hull are used for birth control, constipation, leprosy, and syphilis. Castor oil is used as a laxative for constipation, to start labor in pregnancy, and to start the flow of breast milk.
<h3>Planning</h3>
<p>Castor bean plants need a full sun location and lots of heat to grow their best. They will tolerate shade, but the plant will stay small.

Choose a location in your garden where the castor bean plant will be protected from high winds. It’s best to grow castor plants in fertile soil that drains quickly. They like a lot of water, but they don’t like soggy soil. </p>
<p>Castor bean plant seeds can be sown directly in the garden; but in areas with short growing seasons like mine, it’s best to start them indoors 4-6 weeks before last frost. Castor plant seeds are not a good candidate for winter sowing, they will only rot.

Castor bean plants can be challenging to grow from seed, but there are a few steps you can take to make it easy to germinate castor seeds.</p>
<h3>Irrigation</h3>
<p>The irrigation of castor especially the dwarf hybrids, requires considerable skill to obtain maximum yields.
The plant is extremely sensitive to excess soil water at all stages of growth.
In areas where there are common high winds in dry season, the crop is more liable to uprooting.
Standing water also increased the fungal infections, especially if it is in contact with the stem at a soil level.
Young seedlings are very susceptible to various collor rots, and pre-planting water applications are to be preferred to immediate post emergence application.
Castor being a deep rooted crop, can extract water from considerable depth in the soil.</p>
<h3>Disease Management</h3>
<li>Ill drained, damp and low lying localities should be avoided for sowing castor.
Seed dressing with 4gms g Trichoderma viride formulation and 3g metalaxyl per kg seed can reduce disease incidence. Soil drenching with copper oxychloride @3g /lit or metalaxyl 2g/lit is also useful.</li>
